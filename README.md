# SampleParts
 Examples of parts designed in SolidWorks and other 3D modeling tools  
 
01_Knife_bracket  
>A 3D printed replacement for a missing end cap on a magnetic knife rack drawn from measurements of its counterpart.
02_Hotbar_work_holder_microview  
>A machined aluminum work holder for a specialized soldering tool used by SparkFun production.  
03_Ball_end_mill_tray_insert  
>A tray to keep a variety of end mill bits organized in a tool crib drawer.  
04_Ryan_arm_motion_model  
>Full assembly of the arm design for DreamFace. Unfortunately, the design files for this project are not available for sharing. This model incorporates design for machined, of-the-shelf, and 3D printed parts using surface modeling techniques.
05_Dog_collar_enclosure_iterations,  
06_Dog_collar_on_dog  
>Rapid prototyping iterations of a color-changing light-up dog collar I made for my dog as a personal project using Fusion360 for the 3D printed enclosure and WS2812 LEDs controlled by an Arduino for the color lights.
